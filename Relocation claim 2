Dear [HR Representative's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inquire about the initial relocation benefits that were discussed during the induction and training period at the company. As mentioned to us, the company provides support for first-time travel and accommodation when associates visit their base location.

I joined the company on 28th June 2022 and completed my training on 18th September 2022. As per the training schedule, it is now time for me to make my first visit to my base location. Therefore, I would like to request confirmation regarding my eligibility for the initial relocation benefits.

To facilitate my visit, I kindly ask for your assistance in providing the necessary details and steps to avail of this relocation policy. If there are any specific forms or documents that I need to complete, please let me know, and I will promptly provide all the required information.

I understand that the company has its policies and guidelines, and I want to ensure that I follow the proper procedures. Your guidance and support in this matter would be greatly appreciated, as it would enable me to make the necessary arrangements for my travel and accommodation.

Thank you for your attention to this request. I look forward to receiving your response at your earliest convenience.
