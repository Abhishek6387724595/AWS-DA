Subject: Request for Initial Relocation Benefits Confirmation

Dear [HR Representative's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inquire about the initial relocation benefits that were mentioned to me during the training period at the company. As per the information provided, associates are eligible for travel and hotel accommodation support from the company during their first visit.

I am currently in the process of planning my first visit, and I wanted to confirm whether I can avail of this relocation policy. It would be greatly appreciated if you could provide me with the necessary details and steps to proceed with the arrangement of my travel and accommodation.
